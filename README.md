Hi there! 👋🏻

I'm Giovanni Argentiero and I'm a **Full Stack Developer Freelance**.

I can code with frameworks and libraries such as **Vue**, **React**, **Bootstrap** and **Laravel** or with plain languages like **JavaScript**, **PHP**, **SQL**, **SCSS** and obviously **HTML** & **CSS**. I am also able to implement external works in my code using for example libraries, plugins or APIs.

I enjoy learning new coding skills almost everyday and in my spare time because I see **programming** as an ***art*** and I really love to express myself writing tons of lines of code. <br>

When I write code I always do my best to find a way to optimize it and every time it becomes a challenge between me and myself.
